# Maze
“Maze” is a game written in C. I did it as extra work at an Imperative Programming course assignment. The aim of the game is to reach the end of the maze with the “sun” sprite, without touching the walls. The maze is created by reading a text file with coordinates. I wanted to see how this method works, but is definitely more costly than the usual matrix of tiles approach.  

Future optimizations can be: including a timer to force the player finish at a certain time, including background music, developing other levels with higher difficulty.
